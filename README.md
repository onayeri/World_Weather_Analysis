# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overveiw:

##### The purpose of this assignmet was to utilize API's as a way of accessing public information and implementsing that information into the form of data tables and visualizations that can be used for specific information that is called through these API keys. For this project Google weather, map and diretions APIs were used to obtain info of cities, hotels, weather, and directions from data tables. I was able to get a data table of weather description for each city in the first deliverable. Tjhe sencod deliverable invovled visualizing and pinpointing the cities information in a google map visualization. The third deliverable allowed me to use similar vsualizations as the second deliverable, but this time I added a layer to the map that specified direction and included a route for the cities that I selected. These raph are great for planning trip and helps create an iterary that will work best for travelers.
